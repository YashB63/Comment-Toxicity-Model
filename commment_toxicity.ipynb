If a Christian European is born in the middle east, should he be called a \"\"Christian arab\"\" because of that reason alone? Please understand, they are Syriac Christians (i.e. of Assyrian ancestry), and most of them speak Aramaic, though a lot of them are forgetting it. As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they\\'re in the middle east.

      "    of token indices (one example = 1D tensor of integer token indices) or a\n",
      "    dense representation (one example = 1D tensor of float values representing\n",

      "    pre-tokenized strings) see `tf.keras.layers.StringLookup`.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The vocabulary for the layer must be either supplied on construction or\n",
      "    learned via `adapt()`. When this layer is adapted, it will analyze the\n",
      "    dataset, determine the frequency of individual string values, and create a\n",
      "    vocabulary from them. This vocabulary can have unlimited size or be capped,\n",
      "    depending on the configuration options for this layer; if there are more\n",
      "    unique values in the input than the maximum vocabulary size, the most\n",
      "    frequent terms will be used to create the vocabulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The processing of each example contains the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Standardize each example (usually lowercasing + punctuation stripping)\n",
      "    2. Split each example into substrings (usually words)\n",

      "       `[[\"string to split\"], [\"another string to split\"]]`, the Callable will\n",
      "       see `[\"string to split\", \"another string to split\"]`. The callable should\n",
      "       return a Tensor with the first dimension containing the split tokens -\n",
